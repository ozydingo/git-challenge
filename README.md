# git-challenge

## Exercise 1
Check out `git log`. You will see 50 numbered commits and 1 commit labeled "Mistake!!!". Remove the mistaken commit without modifying any other commits. That is, set your git head to be in a state or branch that has all 50 numbered commits in the same order but does *not* have the mistake commit.
