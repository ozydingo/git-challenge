# git-challenge
Template repo for constructing devz-challenges

This repo has no useful code! Instead, it will have a series of branchs and manufactured commits to present various challenges for you to work on to 1337 your git skillz. Enjoy!

This repo has and will have many branches named `exercise1`, `exercize2`, etc. Check them out! In each, this `README.md` file will have a description of an exercise to accomplish on that branch. When you are done, you can check out some solutions on the `exercise1-solutions` (etc) branch. If you get stuck, try typing `hint` from the root of the repo on the exercise branch. You can pass `hint` an argument to display a specific hint, or try `hint reset` to reset your hint index for that branch.
